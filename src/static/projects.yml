    One of the earliest known examples of a competitive Pokémon AI, Shanai is most notable for the
    creation of the ["Shanai
    Cup"](https://web.archive.org/web/20110706011535/http://pokemon-online.eu/forums/showthread.php?6273),
    a simplified variant of Pokémon that hoped to serve as the testbed for AI development. Shanai
    only supported this restricted Generation V variant and its [core
    algorithm](https://github.com/nixeagle/shanai/blob/20f11841/PO/Client/client.lisp#L370) can be
    recognized as an extension of the rudimentary [MaxDamagePlayer](/glossary#MaxDamagePlayer)
    benchmark. The project also contains the [beginnings of a reverse damage
    calculator](https://github.com/nixeagle/shanai/blob/20f11841/Pokemon/formulas.lisp), though
    ultimately the project was abandoned before this feature was incorporated.

    An early agent targeting the [Generation VI OU
    format](https://www.smogon.com/dex/xy/formats/ou/) that leverages [depth
    2](https://github.com/vasumv/pokemon_ai/blob/0adbf47d/showdownai/game.py#L25) [sequentialized
    pure minimax search with Alpha-beta
    pruning](https://github.com/vasumv/pokemon_ai/blob/0adbf47d/showdownai/agent.py) and a
    [hand-crafted evaluation
    function](https://github.com/vasumv/pokemon_ai/blob/0adbf47d/showdownai/gamestate.py#L46) to
    play with [predefined teams](https://github.com/vasumv/pokemon_ai/tree/0adbf47d/teams). While
    eschewing expectiminimax or a simultaneous-move minimax, the AI does experiment between both
    optimistic and pessimistic sequentializations, seemingly preferring the latter.

    The AI takes an unorthodox approach towards integrating with the Pokémon Showdown platform,
    relying on a [scriptable headless browser](https://phantomjs.org/) instead of the more obvious
    [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) API, complicating
    [connection](https://github.com/vasumv/pokemon_ai/blob/0adbf47d/showdown_ai/browser.py) and
    [parsing](https://github.com/vasumv/pokemon_ai/blob/0adbf47d/showdownai/log.py), possibly due to
    misunderstandings or platform limitations that are no longer relevant.

    The agent relies on a custom engine for [simulating
    actions](https://github.com/vasumv/pokemon_ai/blob/0adbf47d/showdownai/simulator.py#L228),
    replete with simplified [move
    handler](https://github.com/vasumv/pokemon_ai/blob/0adbf47d/showdownai/handlers.py) and [damage
    calculator](https://github.com/vasumv/pokemon_ai/blob/0adbf47d/showdownai/moves.py#L63)
    implementations. The AI's game state is
    [patched](https://github.com/vasumv/pokemon_ai/blob/0adbf47d/showdownai/showdown.py#L149)
    between actions to better keep it sync with the server state.

    The AI features relatively sophisticated team prediction capabilities:
    [movesets](https://github.com/vasumv/pokemon_ai/blob/0adbf47d/data/poke3.json) are
    [scraped](https://github.com/vasumv/pokemon_ai/blob/0adbf47d/smogon/smogon.py) from Smogon
    University, falling back on data from the prior generation where necessary. These serve as the
    basis for an opponent's predicted set, though with the set's moves instead replaced with the
    moves that occur most frequently as computed from a [replay
    database](https://github.com/vasumv/pokemon_ai/blob/0adbf47d/log_scraper/database.py) consisting
    of logs from [top ladder
    players](https://github.com/vasumv/pokemon_ai/blob/0adbf47d/log_scraper/log_scraper.py). This
    database is also used to produce [$`P(Move |
    Move)`](https://github.com/vasumv/pokemon_ai/blob/0adbf47d/data/graph_move.json) and [$`P(Move |
    Pokemon \land Move)`](https://github.com/vasumv/pokemon_ai/blob/0adbf47d/data/graph_poke3.json)
    correlations that allow the agent to use Bayesian inference as further moves get revealed to
    better predict an opponent's moveset.

    0 ERROR exists as the theoretical motivating use case behind the [pkmn](https://pkmn.cc)
    project. While the actual agent is currently vaporware, pkmn has been building foundational
    Pokémon infrastructure that has been used within multiple other Pokémon AI projects:

      - [pkmn/ps](https://github.com/pkmn/ps): Pokémon Showdown's simulator and client broken up
      into composable libraries.
      - [data.pkmn.cc](https://data.pkmn.cc): An aggregated source exposing all of Smogon
      University's data in machine-readable form.
      - [pkmn/stats](https://github.com/pkmn/stats): A framework for efficient Pokémon Showdown
      battle log processing and usage stats generation.
      - [pkmn/engine](https://github.com/pkmn/engine): A minimal, complete, battle simulation engine
      optimized for performance.
      - [EPOKé](https://github.com/pkmn/EPOke): An enhanced client library which tracks not only the
      observed state of the battle, but also uses the mechanics of the game, reverse damage
      calculation, and usage statistics to infer as much as possible about the state of play.
