agent: |
  An intelligent agent ([IA]{.dfn}) is an entity that autonomously acts upon an environment to
  achieve its goals. In computer Chess the individual agents are usually referred to as "engines",
  but in competitive Pokémon artificial intelligence circles "agent" or "[bot](#bot)" is prefered as
  [engine](#engine) is used to refer to the piece code responsible for the simuluation of core
  Pokémon battle mechanics.
Alpha-Beta: |
  Alpha-beta pruning is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are
  evaluated by the [minimax](#minimax) algorithm in its search tree. When applied to a standard
  minimax tree, it returns the same move as minimax would, but [prunes](#pruning) away branches that
  cannot possibly influence the final decision. Alpha-beta has been shown to also work by
  [simultaneous move](#SM) games in [(Bošanský 2013)](/research#Bošanský:2013){.subtle} and
  [(Saffidine 2021)](/research#Saffidine:2021){.subtle}.
AlphaGo: |
  An influential artificial intelligence agent which achieved superhuman
  [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) performance using a combination of Monte-carlo tree
  search and neural networks [(Silver 2016)](/research#Silver:2016){.subtle}. Along with AlphaZero
  [(Silver 2017)](/research#Silver:2017){.subtle} and MuZero [(Silver
  2018)](/research#Silver:2018){.subtle}, the AlphaGo architecture serves as the modern foundation
  for many perfect information game-playing agents (_e.g._, [Lc0](#Lc0)).

  switching and cause damage for multiple turns (also known as "wrapping" or "partial-trapping"
  moves).
