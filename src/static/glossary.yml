abstraction: |
  A method for solving incomplete information games that are too large to be solved in their
  original form. The original game is abstracted to create a smaller game that is strategically
  similar, such that the new abstract game can be solved and the solution can be mapped back to the
  original to serve as an approximation to the true solution to the original game. In Pokémon,
  techniques such as [bucketing](#bucketing) can be used to reduce the state space, or the original
  game may be mapped to a [variant](#variant) which is more tractable.
action: |
  A feasible operation on the [state](#state) ---  _i.e._, a move a [player](#player) can make at a
  stage in the [game](#game). [move]{.dfn} is ambiguous in Pokémon, as Pokémon have
  [moves](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Move) and thus some of the game theoretical moves
  of a player in a Pokémon battle includes the action of literally using one of their Pokémon's
  moves. [Pokémon Showdown!](#PS) and [pkmn](#pkmn) instead use the terms _choice_ and _choices_
  instead of _action_ and _actions_, and [poke-sim](https://github.com/aed3/poke-sim/) refers to
  this as a [_decision_](https://github.com/aed3/poke-sim/blob/main/DESIGN_SPEC.md#decision) - all
  of these should be interchangeable, though using move to refer to an action/choice/decision should
  be avoided. Both player's choices considered together are called the [joint action]{.dfn}, and
  applying the join action to the battle state causes a [transition](#transition).
agent: |
  An intelligent agent ([IA]{.dfn}) is an entity that autonomously acts upon an environment to
  achieve its goals. In computer chess the individual agents are usually referred to as _engines_,
  but in competitive Pokémon artificial intelligence circles agent or [bot](#bot) is prefered as
  [engine](#engine) is used to refer to the code responsible for the simulation of core Pokémon
  battle mechanics.
Alpha-beta: |
  Alpha-beta pruning is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are
  evaluated by the [minimax](#minimax) algorithm in its search tree. When applied to a standard
  minimax tree, it returns the same move as minimax would, but [prunes](#pruning) away branches that
  cannot possibly influence the final decision. Alpha-beta has been shown to also work by
  [simultaneous move](#SM) games in [(Bošanský 2013)](/research#Bošanský:2013){.subtle} and
  [(Saffidine 2021)](/research#Saffidine:2021){.subtle}.

  with AlphaZero [(Silver 2017)](/research#Silver:2017){.subtle} and MuZero [(Silver
  2018)](/research#Silver:2018){.subtle}, the AlphaGo architecture serves as the modern foundation

anytime: |
  An anytime algorithm is an algorithm that can return a valid solution to a problem even if it is
  interrupted before it ends.
bandit: |
  The [multi-armed bandit problem]{.dfn} is a classic [reinforcement learning](#RL) problem that
  exemplifies the exploration--exploitation tradeoff dilemma. In the problem a fixed limited set of
  resources must be allocated between competing (alternative) choices in a way that maximizes their
  expected gain, when each choice's properties are only partially known at the time of allocation,
  and may become better understood as time passes or by allocating resources to the choice. In terms
  of competitive Pokémon AIs bandit problems arise when determining which parts of the [search tree
  to explore](#TBS), and _bandit_ usually refers to the particular type of algorithm being used to
  solve the bandit problem (_e.g._, [UCB](#UCB) or [Exp3](#Exp3)).

  [Bayesian Elo Rating](https://www.remi-coulom.fr/Bayesian-Elo/), a commonly used tool for
  estimating the [Elo](#Elo) rating based on matches between computerized agents.
belief: |
  Describes the probability of an event or information. The belief of a player in a given
  [information set](#information-set) determines what node in that information set he believes the
  game has reached. The belief may be a probability distribution over the nodes in the information
  set, and is typically a probability distribution over the possible types of the other players.
bimatrix game: |
  A [simultaneous game](#SM) for two players in which each player has a finite set of actions. Such
  a game can be fully described by two matrices, each describing the payoffs of one of the players.
binding: |

  representative of that interval. This is a form of [abstraction](#abstraction), the canonical
  examples of bucketing in competitive Pokémon AI research are reducing the range of possible hit
  point values or shrinking the number of damage [rolls](#roll).

  the standard case of Pokémon the client only has a partial representation of one perspective of
  the actual battle state stored on the [server](#server). Clients connect to the server and
  communicate with the server via a [protocol](#protocol), and by default this protocol does not
  share hidden [information](#information).
conmeta: |
  A constructed [metagame](#metagame) where the artificially created rules have been arbitrarily

  Cup](https://web.archive.org/web/20110706011535/http://pokemon-online.eu/forums/showthread.php?6273).
consolidation: |
  Action consolidation is a technique for combining the results of actions with identical outcomes.
  Consolidation is similar to [transpositions](#transposition) in that they both involve
  [symmetry](#symmetry), with the difference being that consolidation allows for skipping similar
  work by leveraging past results whereas [transposition tables](#TT) allow for skipping work that
  has already been done. [Damage coalition](#damage-coalition) is a common form of consolidation in
  competitive Pokémon AI.
contempt: |
  The contempt factor reflects the estimated superiority/inferiority of the program over its
  opponent. Programs incorporating contempt may choose to follow different strategies against
  opponents of varying perceived skill level.
damage calculator: TODO
damage coalition: |
  A common form of [action consolidation](#consolidation) where damage [rolls](#roll) which produce
  the same results get combined. Damage rolls often result in the same outcome due to rounding or
  if the damage gets _capped_ due to causing a target to faint or breaking a Substitute.

  possible [Nash equilibrium](#NE) solutions in a [bimatrix game](#bimatrix-game).
EFG: |
  An [extensive-form game]{.dfn} is a specification of a [game](#game) allowing for the explicit
  representation of a number of key aspects, like the sequencing of players' possible moves, their
  choices at every [decision point](#turn), the (possibly imperfect) [information](#information)
  each player has about the other player's moves when they make a decision, and their
  [payoffs](#payoff) for all possible game outcomes. Extensive-form games also allow for the
  representation of incomplete information in the form of [chance events](#chance) modeled as _moves
  by nature_. Alternatives to the extensive-form game respresentation is the [normal-form]{.dfn}
  representation that simply boils the game down to a payoff [matrix](#bimatrix-game), for the

  either be viewed as the combination of the [team-building](#piloting) and [piloting](#piloting)
  components (and sometimes even featuring an initial [drafting](#drafting) component) or simply the
  piloting aspect. In most cases, without additional qualifiers the _game_ can usually be understood
  to exclusively refer to the piloting component.
game tree: |
  A graph representing all possible game [states](#state) within a [game](#game). The [complete game
  tree]{.dfn} for a game is the game tree starting at the initial state and containing all possible
  [moves](#action) from each state and is equivalent to the tree obtained from the [extensive-form
  game](#EFG) representation). Given that is usually intractable to enumerate the entire game tree
  in Pokémon, AI agents usually search over a [partial game tree]{.dfn} which contains a subset of
  the nodes from the complete game tree.

learning: |
  Learning refers to machine learning ([ML]{.dfn}), where statistical algorithms are leveraged to
  generalize and perform tasks without explicit instructions. There three main categories of
  machine learning are:

  1. Supervised learning, where both example inputs and their desired outputs are provided
  2. Unsupervised learning, only the inputs are provided, and

  node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed
  along to the next layer of the network.
NNUE: |
  An [efficiently updatable [neural network](#NN)]{.dfn}, stylized _ƎUИИ_, an architecture intended
  to replace the [evaluation function](#value) of [alpha-beta](#Alpha-beta) searches running on a
  CPU via [SIMD](#SIMD) instructions. [Originally developed for Computer
  Shogi](https://github.com/asdfjkl/nnue/blob/main/nnue_en.pdf), NNUE has been used successfully in
  chess engines such as [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) to acheive high ratings.
observation: |
  Information produced when the [state](#state) [transitions](#transition). In Pokémon this may
  include a result which can be used to determine [payoff](#payoff) and possibile legal
  [actions](#action), _logs_ which detail various events that may have occured, an account of the
  [chance](#chance) actions, or a multitude of other possibilities depending on the
  [engine](#engine).
offline: |
  An offline algorithm is given the whole problem data from the beginning and is required to output
  an answer which solves the problem at hand. If something can be done _offline_ that usually means
  that it can be precomputed ahead-of-time, as opposed to in the middle of a game (contrast to
  [online](#online)).
online: |
   An online algorithm is one that can process its input piece-by-piece in a serial fashion, _i.e._,
   in the order that the input is fed to the algorithm, without having the entire input available
   from the start (in contrast to [offline](#offline)).
opponent modeling: TODO
OTL: |
  One-[turn](#turn) [look ahead](#look-ahead). The [MaxDamagePlayer](#MaxDamagePlayer) is the
  conventional name for an agent which leverages only a single turn of look ahead.  _$`N`TL_ can be
  used to generalize this shorthand for describing the depth an agent searches to, _e.g._, _3TL_ for
  three turns worth of look ahead.
pathology: |
  Game-tree pathology is a phenomenon where searching a game-tree deeper gives results in worse
  decision.
payoff: |
  The reward a player receives from arriving at a particular outcome. In Pokémon, only terminal
  states give rewards, where the reward is determined based on the result of the battle (winning,
  losing or drawing --- though pedantically, Pokémon glitches mean that one also needs to support
  the notion of a battle ending in _error_ which can usually be mapped to a draw) and the
  utility/reward function (which will usually map [W/L/T](#WLT) to `1/-1/0` making Pokémon a
  [zero-sum](#zero-sum) game or `1/0/0.5` making Pokémon a [constant-sum](#zero-sum) game, the
  latter being more common).

  the pkmn [engine](#engine), [`libpkmn`](https://pkmn.cc/engine)) and is often what is being
  referenced (and is always what is being referred to when prefixed with an _@_, as @pkmn is the
  name of the [organization](https://github.com/pkmn)).
player: |
  A strategic decision-maker within the context of the game. In Pokémon these are usually referred
  to as _Player 1_ and _Player 2_ (alternatively, _P1_/_P2_ or _Player A_/_Player B_) and are
  technically not completely [symmetrical](#symmetry) because certain game mechanics depend on the
  notion of the _host_ player (conventionally P1). In more general terms, either P1 or P2 may be
  considered the _player_ vs. the _enemy_ / _foe_ depending on [perspective](#perspective) --- the
  P1 vs. P2 distinction is absolute whereas the less specific player vs. foe terminology is
  relative. When considering Pokémon as a [bimatrix game](#bimatrix-game) the _row player_ and
  _column player_ are usually also used to refer to relative perspectives.

policy: |
  A policy is a [state](#state) to [action](#action) mapping --- for each action possible from a
  given state, a policy returns the probability of taking the action. Ultimately, the objective of a
  competitive Pokémon AI is to determine the optimal policy for any given state. [Reinforcement
  learning](#RL) aims to accomplish this by learning a [policy network]{.dfn}.
POMDP: |
  Partially observable Markov decision process, a generalization of a [Markov decision

  moves used by a Pokémon of the same type.
state: |
  The information required to determine which [actions](#action) are available to each
  [player](#player). In Pokémon, this is the *battle*, and the term _battle_ is used as opposed to
  _state_ as _state_ is a loaded term in programming (programming in general is arguably all about
  the management of state, so _state_ needs to be qualified as _battle state_ or _game state_ to be
  unambigious) despite it being a useful term in papers dealing purely with theory.

  The change that a [state](#state) undergoes due to an [action](#action). In the [pkmn](#pkmn)
  engine, this is implemented by a a battle's `update` function. In game theory, _turns_
  typically count transitions (though [not in Pokémon](#turn)), and a transition may produce a
  [payoff](#payoff) or some sort of [observation](#observation).
transitions: |
  The entire set of possible [transitions](#transition) from any given [state](#state). While every
  Pokémon game engine must allow for performing a single transition, performing _all_ transitions at
  once and returning the set of states is a less common feature, and almost always when
  _transitions_ or `transitions` is used in conversation as a noun it is referring to this
  functionality.
transposition: |
  A sequence of moves that results in a position that may also be reached by another, more common
  sequence of moves. Transpositions are a type of [symmetry](#symmetry) and are often handled via
  [transposition table](#TT). True transpositions are uncommon in Pokémon unless some level of
  [abstraction](#abstraction) has been applied.
TT:
  A [transposition table]{.dfn} is a cache of previously seen positions, and associated evaluations,
  in a [game tree](#game-tree) generated by a computer game playing program. If a position recurs
  via a different sequence of moves, the value of the position is retrieved from the table, avoiding
  re-searching the game tree below that position.
TBS: |
  [Tree-bandit search]{.dfn}, the name for the family of search algorithms which are roughly based
  around [Monte-carlo tree search](#MCTS) but which make use of various [bandit](#bandit) algorithms
  to greatly improve performance and convergence.
tuning: |
  The process of maximizing a [machine learning](#learning) model's performance without overfitting
  or creating too high of a variance, usually via [hyperparameters](#hyperparameter).
turn: |
  Game theory uses the term [ply]{.dfn} to refer to one turn taken by one player in a
  [sequential](#SM) game which doesn't apply to Pokémon given that Pokémon is a [simultaneous](#SM)
  game. A _turn_ in Pokémon is a well-defined concept as certain game mechanics depend on its
  definition (_e.g._, residual damage happens at the end of a turn in Pokémon in later generations).
  Instead, it is more useful to in terms of [decision point]{.dfn} that occur between _updates_ to
  the battle state (which may happen multiple times in a single turn, _e.g._, due to a Pokémon using
  Baton Pass or fainting) --- places where the game requires input from players to proceed. In
  [Pokémon Showdown!](#PS) and the [pkmn](#pkmn) engine, a decision point always requires a [joint
  action](#action), introducing the concept of _passing_/_waiting_ to account for situations where
  on a console one of the players is forced to do nothing while input is collected from their
  opponent.
UCB: |
  Upper Confidence Bound, a [bandit](#bandit) algorithm commonly used in [tree
  bandit search](#TBS).
UCT: |
  Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees, the contemporary standard implementation of [Monte-carlo
  tree search](#MCTS) which uses the [UCB](#UCB) algorithm to select promising child nodes to
  expand. See also [tree bandit search](#TBS).
uniform policy: |
  A [policy](#policy) which assigns equal (uniform) probability to each of the actions possible ---
  this sort of policy is usually only optimal in the absence of any other information (_e.g._, at
  the beginning of a search).
usage stats: |
  Statistics processed from a corpus of battle logs that detail the usage of various Pokémon and
  their attributes for a given format. [Smogon University](#Smogon) produces [public
  statistics](https://www.smogon.com/stats/) calculated from all rated battles on [Pokémon
  Showdown!](#PS) each month which they use to influence the tiering decisions for the
  [formats](#format) they maintain, though alternative usage statistics can also be produced for
  specific use cases.
value: |
  The expected [payoff](#payoff) from a given [state](#state), produced by an [evaluation
  function]{.dfn}. Evaluation functions are usually difficult to produce accurately in Pokémon and
  are often approximated with [reinforcement learning](#RL) via  a [value network]{.dfn} in that
  assigns a value to each state of the game by calculating an expected cumulative score.
vaporware: |
  Software that has been advertised but is not yet available to use/buy, either because it is only a
  concept or because it is still being written or designed. See also [pkmn](#pkmn).
variant: |
  A variation from the standard rules of competitive Pokémon which usually simplifies/relaxes
  certain properties/rules of the game to make it more tractable for AI, with the expectation that
  solutions to a variant will usually be useful for generalizing to the original ruleset. In
  computer poker, [Kuhn poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuhn_poker) is the most common
  simplification studied, whereas in Pokémon there are [numerous potential options of
  variants](/concepts/variants). Note that while the various Pokémon [formats](#format) can be
  considered variants, the term _variant_ is reserved to describe simplifications to the game that
  go beyond the rule changes typical between formats.
WLT: |
  WLT or W/L/T refers to win, loss and tie (draw) record of a particular [player](#player) or
  [agent](#agent).
wincon: |
  A [win condition]{.dfn} is a Pokémon or scenario that a player needs in order to secure that they
  win the game.
zero-sum: |
  A [zero-sum game]{.dfn} is a mathematical representation in game theory of a situation that
  involves two sides, where the result is an advantage for one side and an equivalent loss for the
  other, such that the net improvement in benefit of the game is zero. Zero-sum games are a specific
  example of a [constant-sum game]{.dfn}, a concept when the sum of the players' gains and losses is
  a fixed constant $`C`. Constant-sum games can be trivially transformed into a zero-sum game by
  subtracting $`C` from every [payoff](#payoff).
